## 1. The Problem

Pet owners love their companions, but understanding subtle cues about their health, breed mix, or even just estimating their age can be challenging without professional help. Grooming needs also vary significantly by breed and coat type, leaving many owners unsure about the best approach or frequency. Owners often rely on guesswork or infrequent vet visits for these insights. There's a need for an accessible, quick, and easy-to-use tool that can provide basic, visual-based insights into their pet's characteristics and potential needs.

## 2. The Solution: Purr Check AI

Purr Check AI addresses this by leveraging the power of AI, specifically large language models with vision capabilities, to analyze photos of dogs and cats. By simply uploading a photo and optionally adding some context (like known behaviors or quirks), users can receive an immediate, AI-generated assessment. This assessment provides estimations on breed mix, age, a summary of apparent physical condition, and tailored recommendations for grooming services and frequency. This offers a convenient, non-invasive way for pet owners to gain initial insights from the comfort of their home.

## 3. How it Should Work (User Experience)

The user experience is designed to be simple, intuitive, and focused on delivering the core value proposition quickly.

* **Landing Page:** A clean and inviting page that clearly explains what Purr Check AI does. The primary call to action is the photo upload area. An optional text box is available for additional context.
* **Upload & Processing:** The user uploads a photo and optionally enters text. Upon clicking "Upload" or "Get Assessment," the application processes the data in the background. A loading indicator should provide feedback.
* **Free Assessment Page:** After processing, the user is presented with the assessment results. This page clearly displays the AI's findings: estimated breed(s), estimated age, a summary of the pet's apparent condition based on the photo, and personalized grooming recommendations (type of service, recommended frequency). This assessment is clearly marked as the user's free trial.
* **Paywall:** After the free assessment, any attempt to perform another assessment triggers a paywall. This page explains the value of the subscription tiers and presents the pricing options (Purr Check Diary, Pack Check Diary).
* **Subscription Flow:** Users select a subscription tier and are guided through the Stripe payment process. Upon successful payment, they gain access to their subscribed features.
* **Subscribed User Experience:**
    * **Purr Check Diary:** Users can upload more photos (up to 5/week), and the system will track their assessments. A "Diary" section allows viewing past assessments, comparing photos over time, and potentially seeing AI-generated trends or changes in condition (future feature).
    * **Pack Check Diary:** In addition to the Purr Check Diary features, users can create multiple pet profiles and manage assessments for each pet separately.

## 4. User Experience Goals

* **Simplicity:** The process of getting an assessment should be straightforward and require minimal steps.
* **Speed:** While AI processing takes time, the user should receive feedback quickly (loading states) and the final assessment within a reasonable timeframe (seconds to a few minutes, depending on model latency).
* **Clarity:** The assessment results should be presented clearly and easy to understand, even for non-experts.
* **Trustworthiness:** While not a replacement for vet advice, the results should feel credible and be presented with appropriate disclaimers. The design should feel professional and reliable.
* **Value Proposition:** The value of the free assessment should be immediately apparent, and the benefits of the subscription tiers should be clearly communicated at the paywall.

## 5. Future Vision

The long-term vision includes expanding to native mobile apps for a more integrated user experience, potentially incorporating features like reminders for grooming or vet visits, integrating with pet health tracking APIs (if available), and continuously improving the accuracy and depth of the AI assessments. The diary feature could evolve to provide more sophisticated trend analysis and insights into a pet's long-term well-being.
