## 1. Technologies Used (Proposed Initial Stack)

* **Frontend:**
    * **Framework:** [e.g., React]
    * **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
    * **Package Manager:** npm or yarn
    * **Styling:** CSS Modules or Styled Components
    * **Deployment:** Netlify, Vercel, or static hosting on cloud provider.
* **Backend:**
    * **Language:** [e.g., Node.js]
    * **Framework:** [e.g., Express]
    * **Package Manager:** npm or yarn
    * **Database Driver/ORM:** [e.g., `pg` for PostgreSQL, Sequelize or TypeORM]
    * **File Upload Handling:** Multer or similar middleware.
    * **Deployment:** Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, or Docker containers on Kubernetes.
* **Database:**
    * **Type:** Relational Database
    * **System:** [e.g., PostgreSQL]
    * **Hosting:** Managed database service on a cloud provider (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL) or self-hosted.
* **AI Integration:**
    * **Provider:** [e.g., OpenAI Vision API, Google Cloud Vision AI, Anthropic Claude with Vision]
    * **Client Library:** Official API client library for the chosen provider.
* **Payment Processing:**
    * **Provider:** Stripe
    * **Client Library:** Stripe Node.js library or similar for the backend language.
* **Cloud Provider (for hosting, database, etc.):** [e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure]

## 2. Development Setup

* **Code Editor:** VS Code, Sublime Text, or similar.
* **Version Control:** Git (hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
* **Local Environment:**
    * Node.js and npm/yarn installed.
    * Database server running locally or accessible remotely.
    * Environment variables configured for API keys, database connection strings, etc. (using a `.env` file).
* **Dependency Management:** `package.json` for both frontend and backend dependencies.
* **API Key Management:** Securely store and manage API keys (Stripe, AI provider) using environment variables in development and secret management services in production.

## 3. Technical Constraints

* **AI Model Limitations:** The accuracy and capabilities of the chosen AI model will directly impact the quality of the assessments. Understanding its strengths and weaknesses is crucial.
* **API Rate Limits:** Both the AI model API and Stripe API have rate limits that need to be respected. Implement error handling and potentially retry logic.
* **File Size Limits:** Web server and cloud storage limits on the size of uploaded photos.
* **Processing Time:** AI analysis can take time, requiring asynchronous handling and providing user feedback during processing.
* **Cost:** Usage of external APIs (AI and Stripe) incurs costs, which need to be monitored and factored into pricing.

## 4. Dependencies

* Frontend depends on the Backend API.
* Backend depends on the Database, AI Model API, and Stripe API.
* Deployment infrastructure depends on the chosen cloud provider.

## 5. Tool Usage Patterns

* **Frontend Development:** Use standard development server provided by the framework (e.g., `create-react-app`, Vue CLI) for local development with hot module replacement. Build optimized bundles for production deployment.
* **Backend Development:** Use `nodemon` or similar for automatic server restarts during local development. Implement clear API routes and use middleware for common tasks (parsing requests, handling file uploads).
* **Database Management:** Use database client tools (e.g., `psql`, MySQL Workbench, DBeaver) for schema design, migrations, and data inspection. Implement database migrations to manage schema changes over time.
* **API Interaction:** Use libraries provided by the service providers (AI, Stripe) for interacting with their APIs. Handle API responses and errors gracefully.
* **Deployment:** Automate deployment using CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to ensure consistent and reliable deployments to the chosen hosting platform.

## 6. Security Considerations

* **API Key Security:** Never expose API keys in frontend code. Store them securely in backend environment variables or secret management systems.
* **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user input (text and file uploads) on the backend to prevent security vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Connections:** Use HTTPS for all communication between the frontend, backend, and external services.
* **Stripe Security:** Follow Stripe's security best practices, including using webhooks to confirm payment events rather than relying solely on frontend redirects.
* **Data Privacy:** Handle uploaded photos and assessment data according to privacy best practices and relevant regulations.
