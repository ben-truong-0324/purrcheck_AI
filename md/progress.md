# Progress: Purr Check AI

**Project Name:** Purr Check AI

**Date:** May 8, 2025

**Author:** [Your Name/Team Name]

**Version:** 1.0

## 1. What Works (Completed / Partially Completed)

* Core concept defined and documented in `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`.
* High-level system architecture and technical approach outlined in `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md`.
* Basic database schema structure conceptualized in `system_database.md`.
* Initial development environment setup planned.

## 2. What's Left to Build

* **Frontend:**
    * Complete the responsive landing page design and implementation.
    * Implement photo upload functionality with preview.
    * Develop the assessment results display page layout and styling.
    * Design and implement the paywall page with pricing information.
    * Implement the user flow transitions between pages.
    * (Future: User authentication and profile management, Diary view, Multi-pet profiles).
* **Backend:**
    * Implement API endpoints for photo upload and text submission.
    * Develop logic for storing uploaded photos temporarily or permanently (depending on phase).
    * Integrate with the chosen AI Model API to send data and receive results.
    * Implement logic to parse and process AI model responses into a structured assessment format.
    * Implement the free assessment counter and logic to trigger the paywall redirect.
    * Integrate with the Stripe API to create checkout sessions for subscriptions.
    * Implement webhook handling for Stripe events (e.g., `checkout.session.completed`).
    * Implement logic for managing subscription status based on Stripe webhooks.
    * (Future: User authentication system, Database models and logic for users, pets, and historical assessments, API endpoints for accessing historical data).
* **Database:**
    * Finalize and implement the database schema (tables, columns, relationships).
    * Write database migration scripts.
* **AI Integration:**
    * Select and finalize the specific AI Model API provider and model.
    * Implement robust error handling and retry logic for API calls.
* **Stripe Integration:**
    * Complete the integration of creating and managing Stripe checkout sessions.
    * Implement secure webhook handling and verification.
    * (Future: Handling subscription renewals, cancellations, and potential upgrades/downgrades).

## 3. Current Status

The project is in the initial planning and setup phase. The core idea is defined, and the high-level technical approach has been charted. Development work on specific components (frontend pages, backend endpoints) has not yet begun.

## 4. Known Issues / Challenges

* Determining the most cost-effective and accurate AI model for the specific task.
* Handling potential latency from AI model API calls.
* Implementing a simple yet reasonably effective way to track free assessments without requiring user accounts initially.
* Ensuring secure handling of uploaded photos and payment information.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

* Initial focus is strictly on the web MVP with the core assessment and payment flow. Mobile apps and advanced features are explicitly planned for later phases.
* The approach to free tier tracking has been simplified for the MVP to reduce initial development complexity.
* Reliance on third-party APIs (AI, Stripe) is a deliberate decision to accelerate the initial build. Future considerations might include bringing some functionality in-house if scale and cost justify it.
